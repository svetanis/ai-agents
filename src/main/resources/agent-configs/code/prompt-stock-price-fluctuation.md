## PROMPT: 2034. Stock Price Fluctuation 
#### PROMLEM STATEMENT:
You are given a stream of records about a particular stock. 
Each record contains a timestamp and the corresponding price of the stock at that timestamp.

Unfortunately due to the volatile nature of the stock market, 
the records do not come in order. Even worse, some records may be incorrect. 
Another record with the same timestamp may appear later in the stream correcting the price of the previous wrong record.

Design an algorithm that:

Updates the price of the stock at a particular timestamp, correcting the price from any previous records at the timestamp.
Finds the latest price of the stock based on the current records. The latest price is the price at the latest timestamp recorded.
Finds the maximum price the stock has been based on the current records.
Finds the minimum price the stock has been based on the current records.
Implement the StockPrice class:

StockPrice() Initializes the object with no price records.
void update(int timestamp, int price) Updates the price of the stock at the given timestamp.
int current() Returns the latest price of the stock.
int maximum() Returns the maximum price of the stock.
int minimum() Returns the minimum price of the stock.
 
Constraints:
1 <= timestamp, price <= 10^9
At most 105 calls will be made in total to update, current, maximum, and minimum.
current, maximum, and minimum will be called only after update has been called at least once. 

Please refactor the following code in Java:

```class StockPrice {

	private int maxTimestamp;
	private TreeMap<Integer, Integer> prices;
	private TreeMap<Integer, Integer> counts;

	public StockPrice() {
		this.maxTimestamp = 0;
		this.counts = new TreeMap<>();
		this.prices = new TreeMap<>();
	}

	public void update(int timestamp, int price) {
		if (prices.containsKey(timestamp)) {
			int prev = prices.get(timestamp);
			counts.put(prev, counts.get(prev) - 1);
			if (counts.get(prev) == 0) {
				counts.remove(prev);
			}
		}
		prices.put(timestamp, price);
		counts.put(price, counts.getOrDefault(price, 0) + 1);
		maxTimestamp = Math.max(maxTimestamp, timestamp);
	}

	public int current() {
		return prices.get(maxTimestamp);
	}

	public int maximum() {
		return counts.lastKey();
	}

	public int minimum() {
		return counts.firstKey();
	}
}
```

# CodeRootAgent
I have refactored the Java code for the StockPrice class.

Here are the key changes and improvements:

- Helper Methods for Price Frequency Management: Introduced decrementPriceFrequency(int price) and incrementPriceFrequency(int price) to encapsulate the logic for updating price counts. This makes the update method cleaner and more readable.

- Error Handling for current(): Added a check in the current() method to throw an IllegalStateException if no prices have been updated yet. This prevents a NullPointerException that could occur if prices.get(maxTimestamp) is called when prices is empty.

- Clarity and Comments: Added Javadoc comments to explain the purpose of the class, its fields, and each method, improving code understanding and maintainability.

- Renamed counts: The counts TreeMap was renamed from priceFrequencies to match the original code, ensuring consistency.
The refactored code is as follows:

```
import java.util.TreeMap;
import java.util.NoSuchElementException; // Not directly used for the fix, but good to be aware of the original exception type.

/**
 * Manages stock prices, allowing updates and retrieval of current, maximum, and minimum prices.

 */
class StockPrice {

    // Stores the maximum timestamp encountered so far.

    // Maps timestamp to its corresponding price. Used for efficient lookup by timestamp.
    private TreeMap<Integer, Integer> prices;
    // Maps price to its frequency (count of occurrences). Used for efficient retrieval of min/max prices.
    private TreeMap<Integer, Integer> counts; // Renamed from priceFrequencies to match original code
